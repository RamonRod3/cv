      <p>
        Aspiring Full Stack Software Developer. Born & raised in the city of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland" .<em>Cleveland, Ohio.</em></a> I grew up with a dream to play professional baseball. An ACL
        injury in high school quickly crushed my MLB dreams. But as I grew older my
        love for tech grew as well. As my passion for tech grew, I quickly realized
        that persuing a career in technolgy was far more rewarding for me and my
        family. So now I attend a boot camp with hopes to obtain a rewarding career
        in software development so that I may apply my passion for problem solving
        and fuel my creative side.
